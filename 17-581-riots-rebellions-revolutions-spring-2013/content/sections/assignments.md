The course emphasis is on developing analytical abilities. Accordingly, the graded assignments provide a means for students to practice and demonstrate these abilities.

There are four graded assignments.

*   In-class presentation of an agent-based modeling exercise
*   In-class presentation of a comparative analysis of some aspect of the [Arab Spring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_spring).
*   Final exam
